## How to Set Up and Run a Svelte Application Locally

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up and run a Svelte application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download the latest version of Node.js and npm from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Setting Up the Project

2. Clone the repository using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt, and enter the following command: `git clone git@github.com:phantasma-io/Phantasma-Hub.git`

3. Change the current directory to the cloned repository: `cd Phantasma-Hub`

### Installing Dependencies and Running the Application

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: `npm install`

5. Start the application in development mode using the following command: `npm run start --port 5174`

Now, the Svelte application should be running locally on your machine. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5174` to access the application.

If you need to build the application for production, use the following command: `npm run build`

This will create a `public` folder with the optimized production build.
